Idea for Codefundo++ 2018

The world is paying a high price in lives lost. According to The Times most of them are due to the unawareness and unpredictability of the natural disasters. With the help of advanced technology and support of big organisations (like Microsoft), we are planning to develop a smartphone application(app) that will notify the user about the natural disasters which may occur in his city or around his location. 
The app will have the data of the weather and climate conditions before and during the natural disasters of several years gathered by weather control stations. Through data analysis and machine learning we'll predict the trend of values of properties like temperature, air pressure difference, wind speed and other factors driving various natural calamity, before and after it's occurrence.
With the help of GPS, the app will collect the live data of above factors of the user's location. By comparing the two sets of data, the app will notify the user about the danger level and possibilities of natural disaster.
As it is hardly possible to know exactly when the natural calamity will struck a location, the need is to manage the conditions after a disaster has occurred. The app will provide user the location of relief camps nearest to him, helpline number and other measures taken by government during that time. We can also include the feature which will try to contact the camps giving the victim's location if he is unable to contact by himself. 
Through this initiative , though we can't prevent a natural distaster from occurring, but we surely can save some lives since each life 
counts.
